What is this?
If you’re Alia turn around now pls!
This is a test build of a game I’m making for Alia’s birthday as a gift

How to play:
Download a zip file, each one is a different version, the most recent version rn is “Happy Birthday Alia Backup” but it doesn’t have as many guidelines inside (currently this is the only version available on github, the other one is on drive), inside you will find a folder called “Happy Birthday Alia”, inside of that you will find another folder called “Music” don’t touch this! and a html file called whatever the test build is called, probably something like “Secret Stuff 12” or “Secret Stuff Test Build”, open this file with your browser, preferably chrome as that’s the only one I’ve tested it in and the game should be understandable from there, there is music that starts playing after your first action in the game so beware of volume, but I’ve tried to make the volume bearable no matter settings otherwise there is also a volume slider on the left.
