What is this?
This is a build of a game I’m making for Alia’s birthday

How to play:
Download the zip file, each html file is a different version, the most recent version rn is “Happy Birthday Alia” but it doesn’t have as many guidelines, inside you will find a folder called “Happy Birthday Alia”, inside of that you will find another folder called “Music” don’t touch this! and a html file called whatever the test build is called, open this file with your browser, preferably chrome as that’s the only one I’ve tested it in and the game should be understandable from there, there is music that starts playing after your first action in the game so beware of volume, but I’ve tried to make the volume bearable no matter settings otherwise there is also a volume slider on the left.
